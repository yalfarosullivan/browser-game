# Milestone-Porject-1-Browser-Game

This is a memory match Browser game, created for the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Software Development programe through TriveDX. The inspiration for my game was my daugther and her name is Zara and she loves cats! She has 5, so why not create a game she can match and collect more cats.

To play: Help my character Zara collect all the cats by matching them using your mouse. Choose two cards by clicking once on each card. If the cards do not match, the card will return to their original position to try again. Get points by matching the cats but beware you will lose points if you mismatch. Have fun!


## Technologies used: 
I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  I used alot of function is javascript for the flipping of the cards, add and remove points and random for card suffling. Both the adding/removing of points and the random card was the most difficult.

## Outstaning:
My unfinished functionality is removing the card instead of just flipping and because I love animations I want the gif to move each time points are added.
