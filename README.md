Help Zara collect all the cats by matching them using your mouse. Get points by matching the cats but beware you will lose points if you mismatch. Have fun!

My inspiration for my game is my daugther and her name is Zara and she loves cats! She has 5, so why not create a game she can match and collect.

I used html, javascript, and css.  I used alot of function is javascript for the flipping of the cards, add and remove points and random for card suffling. Both the adding/removing of points and the random card was the most difficult.

My unfinished functionality is removing the card instead of just flipping and because I love animations I want the gif to move each time points are added.
